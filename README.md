p2_sortSearch.h contains:

      quickSort: stand alone function that sorts numbers using the quick sort algorithm
      mergeSort: function that sorts numbers using the merge sort algorithm
      merge: function that assists merge sort
      binarySearch: stand alone function that searches for a number in a vector and returns the position its at
      
p2_hash.h contains: 

      slashHash: hashing function. hashes are usually between 0 and 110 (hash function to be graded)
      simpleHash: hashing function. hashes are usually between 0 and 50 (used for bloom filter)
      bloomFilter: data structure that stores single string in two positions based on the hashes of the string. 
      
 p2_main.cpp contains:
      
       5 unit test functions for each project requirement. 
       main driver to view test results
    
<h3>Make sure to include "randomWords.txt" to the solution. The main driver is tailor-made for this file. It contains the words used to randomly test the hash function and the bloom filter.</h3>
